## About
The Nerd Exam is a website where you can find the best nerd tests!
Here you can take knowledge tests about games, hardware, or gaming.

## Concept
The concept was created based on the Detran SP website, specifically in the simulations area, where I always saw so many programming concepts and wanted to learn about them and put them into practice.

##Recommendations
Due to the limited time I had to create this website, I couldn't make it responsive to mobile devices, so it works well only on computers.

##Challenges
My biggest challenge was in bug fixing, as there were many new things, from the concept of using UseEffect for major tasks to Drag and Hold (my favorite mechanic).

##About the code
It seems simple to explain, but it is a home page that, after completing the Captcha and selecting "Start" on the Virtual Keyboard, shuffles and selects 10 questions from the chosen category. This is done using a UseEffect. The advantage of doing this is that it maintains randomness and allows me to navigate between questions, as they are already saved.
